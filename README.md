### chalkboard Birthday Tracker
#### How to install and run the project
* Clone project https://github.com/astha-iOS/chalkboard-birthday-tracker.git
* Navigate into the directory
* Open `chalkboard-coding-challenges.xcodeproj` into Xcode
* Run the project in xcode

#### Technical choices
* Did not used any library to keep thing simple. For exmaple for making api request `alamofire` could be used
#### Trade off
* Pagination could be implemented
* Loader can be applied while fetching data from user api
* Test cases could be written both for UI and unit testing
